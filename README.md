# parallel-2D-convolution

This project entails implementing two-dimensional convolution on parallel computers using
different parallelization techniques and models.

This project uses [MPICH2](https://www.mpich.org/) and [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/wp/)

## Description of approaches

project.c - Sequential version ([Reference](http://paulbourke.net/miscellaneous/dft/))
project_transpose.c - Sequential version using matrix transpose
project_sr_mpi.c - Parallel version using MPI_Send and MPI_Recv.
project_bcast_mpi.c - Parallel version using MPI_Bcast.
project_openmp_mpi.c - Parallel version using MPI and OpenMP.
project_tasks_mpi.c - Parallel version using 2 processors for each task, has to be run with 8 processors.

## Compile

To compile just run the Makefile:

```bash
$ make
```

To clean:
```bash
make clean
```

## Running

```bash
$ ./project.o

$ ./project_transpose.o

$ mpirun -n <Number of processors> ./project_sr_mpi

$ mpirun -n <Number of processors> ./project_bcast_mpi

$ mpirun -n <Number of processors> ./project_openmp_mpi

$ mpirun -n <Number of processors> ./project_tasks_mpi
```
